# 101inFunctional
Learning materials for the very first course in programming, in [Functional Programming][1] Style.

## Motivation
Almost all of the materials for introductory Functional Programming requires some knowledge/experiences in imperative programming (like in C, Python etc). But what I see, Functional Programming is the direct continuation of high school mathematics. Therefore trying to create one. In the sea of courses like "Functional Programming 101", this material would be "Programming 101 -- in Functional Style". 

I hope this would be an option in the early phases of those who are going to end up choosing Functional Programming Paradigm as their daily dose. 

## Structure
This material will follow the similar approach as [Lambda Calculus][2] to **express Computation** in computers.
However, this material does not assumes readers to be familiar with Lambda Calculus as this will try to explain them both, treating them equivalent.

This will make use of Common Lisp to practice our knowledge on computers, as it is closest to Lambda Calculus. Feel free to install any Common Lisp compiler. I am using [SBCL][3].
