# 101inFunctional
Learning materials for the very first course in programming, in Functional Programming Style.

## Motivation
Almost all of the materials for introductory Functional Programming requires knowledge/experience in imperative programming (like in C, Python etc). But what I see, Functional Programming is the direct continuation of high school mathematics. Therefore trying to create one.

I hope this would be an option in the early phases of those who are going to end up choosing Functional Programming Paradigm as their daily dose. 

## Structure
Programs will be written in Common Lisp for obvious reasons.
