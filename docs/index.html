    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      Almost all of the materials for introductory Functional Programming requires knowledge/experience in 
      imperative programming (like in C, Python etc). But what I see, Functional Programming is the 
      direct continuation of high school mathematics. Therefore trying to create one.

      I hope this would be an option in the early phases of those who are going to end up choosing 
      Functional Programming Paradigm as their daily dose.
