    <h1>101inFunctional</h1>
    <p>
      Learning materials for the very first course in programming, <br> in Functional Programming Style.

    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Almost all of the materials for introductory 
      <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming"><em>Functional Programming,</em></a> 
      requires some knowledge/experiences in imperative programming (like in C, Python etc). 
      But what I see, Functional Programming is the 
      direct continuation of high school mathematics. Therefore trying to create one. 
      In the sea of courses like "Functional Programming 101", this material would be 
      "Programming 101 -- in Functional Style". 
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      I hope this would be an option in the early phases of those who are going to end up choosing 
      Functional Programming Paradigm as their daily dose.
    </p>

    <h2>Structure</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
      This material will follow the similar approach as 
      <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus"><em>Lambda Calculus</em></a> 
      to <strong>express Computation</strong> 
      in computers. However, this material does not assumes readers to be familiar with Lambda Calculus as 
      this will try to explain them both, treating them equivalent.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      This will make use of Common Lisp to practice our knowledge on computers, as it is closest to Lambda Calculus. 
      Feel free to install any Common Lisp compiler.
